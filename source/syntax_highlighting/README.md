### About

This directory contains syntax highlighting rule files for some IDEs/text editors.

Read manual of your IDE/text editor in order to know, how to install/setup custom syntax highlighter.

If no syntax highlighting file for your IDE/text editor exists yet, you can create it yourself.
If you wish other people use your syntax highlighting file, submit a PR to this repository.

### Important notes

When new lexems and/or keywords are added into the language, do not forget to update syntax highlighting rules!

Also make sure various tricky lexems like 2-base, 8-base, 16-base numbers, strings (including escape sequences), comments (especially multiline) are highlighted properly.

### About

This directory contains basic usage examples of some Ü features/constructions.
Each file is a self-contained example.

Note that these examples contain only limited set of all Ü features.
Read the documentation to know more about the language.


### How to build

Use the build system to build each file, like this:

```
BuildSystem build_single some_example.u
```

It's important to specify correct path to the *ustlib*.
Different options may be specified, see the build system documentation for more information.

Alternatively it's possible to build all examples as part of the whole Ü project.

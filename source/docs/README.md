### About

This directory contains language documentation sources.

All language versions are manually-written.
When something in the language is changed, documentation for all languages should be extended/updated.
If you don't know some of the languages, ask some of the developers of the Ãœ project with corresponding language knowledge for help in translation.

### How to build

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation generator is used.
See its documentation for more details.
Since many documentation versions exist, you need to build each of them individually or create a build script to invoke documentation build for each language versions.
It's also possible to build the documentation together with the whole project, a CMake file for it exists.

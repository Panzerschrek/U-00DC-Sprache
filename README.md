## Ü-Sprache

Experimental programming language.  
It is a compilable, statically-typed C++-like language.

Here placed compiler for this language. 
Currently, there are no any docs for this language, all knowledges are concentrated inside compiler and my mind. 
So, this is reference-compiler for this language.

### How to build
* Install llvm (llvm 3.7.1 used in this project).  
* Prebuild llvm.  
* Set path to llvm includes and build dir in CmakeLists.txt.  
* Run Cmake and generate project for your favorite IDE or build system.  

Currently, Ü-Sprache compiler not integrated to llvm-build infrastructure for some reasons. But you could do this, if you wish.
